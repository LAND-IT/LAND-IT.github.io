# Interface

In the center we have the map, where the polygons and all spatial information are displayed.

On the left side is the layers panel, where full layer management is performed — enabling, disabling, reorganizing, and viewing associated information.

And on the right side are the geometric tools, which allow working directly on the polygons: selecting, editing, drawing, or applying more advanced operations.

This is the general overview of the interface.
