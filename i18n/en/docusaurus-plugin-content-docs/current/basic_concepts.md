# Basic Concepts

This document presents the four essential concepts needed to understand how LAND IT works: POSA, POSP, Scenario, and Version. These elements structure the entire process of analysis, planning, and decision-making within the system.

## POSA - Current Land Use Map

The first concept is **POSA — Current Land Use Map**. POSA represents exactly the current state of the territory, that is, how the land is occupied today. It is our reference baseline and allows us to understand what exists on the ground before considering any transformation.

## POSP - Proposed Land Use Map

The second concept is **POSP — Proposed Land Use Map**. POSP describes the future vision for the territory, that is, what the land is intended to become, according to the objectives of the AIGP. While POSA shows the “now”, POSP shows “where we want to go”.

## Scenario

The third concept is the **scenario**. A scenario combines two things: on one hand, the POSP, which represents the proposed land use; and on the other, the costs associated with the transformations required to reach that proposal. Thus, a scenario is not just a drawing: it is a complete and economically evaluated proposal.

## Versions

Finally, each scenario may have several **versions**. A version works as a "saved state" of the scenario. This allows testing alternatives, making adjustments, comparing proposals, and evolving the planning over time. Just like in a version control system, we can track the progression of ideas and retrieve previous versions whenever necessary.
