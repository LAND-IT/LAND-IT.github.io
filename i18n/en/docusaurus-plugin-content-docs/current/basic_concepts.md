# Basic Concepts

This document presents the four essential concepts needed to understand how LAND IT works: POSA, POSP, Scenario, and Version. These elements structure the entire process of analysis, planning, and decision-making within the system.

## POSA - Current Land Use Map

The first concept is **POSA — Current Land Use Map**. POSA represents exactly the current state of the territory, that is, how the land is occupied today. It is our reference baseline and allows us to understand what exists on the ground before considering any transformation.

## POSP - Proposed Land Use Map

The second concept is **POSP — Proposed Land Use Map**. POSP describes the future vision for the territory, that is, what the land is intended to become, according to the objectives of the AIGP. While POSA shows the “now”, POSP shows “where we want to go”.

## Scenario

The third concept is the **scenario**. A scenario combines two things: on one hand, the POSP, which represents the proposed land use; and on the other, the costs associated with the transformations required to reach that proposal. Thus, a scenario is not just a drawing: it is a complete and economically evaluated proposal.

## Versions

Finally, each scenario may have several **versions**. A version works as a "saved state" of the scenario. This allows testing alternatives, making adjustments, comparing proposals, and evolving the planning over time. Just like in a version control system, we can track the progression of ideas and retrieve previous versions whenever necessary.

# Other Concepts

After presenting the basic concepts, there are other important concepts to understand the functioning of **LAND IT**.

## AIGP - Integrated Landscape Management Areas

**AIGP - Integrated Landscape Management Areas** aim to promote the joint management of agricultural and forest areas in regions with smallholdings and high fire risk, increasing resilience and enhancing the value of the territory.

## OIGP - Integrated Landscape Management Operations

**OIGP - Integrated Landscape Management Operations** define the actions necessary to transform the landscape, including crop reconversion, territorial enhancement, and revitalization. They also establish the operational model, financial resources, and the management and monitoring system to be implemented.

## Intervention Units

**Intervention Units** are zones with similar soil, climatic conditions, and land use, where a set of actions with identical characteristics is intended to be carried out, aiming to transform the current use or maintain the existing use. These actions include natural elements, such as points of interest, hedges, walls, terraces, or other infrastructures, whether linear or point-based, which will be the focus of intervention.

## Ecological Structure

The **Ecological Structure** is the set of natural elements that ensure the ecological functioning of the landscape and the conservation of natural resources. This structure includes wetlands, watercourses, valley bottoms, ridges, and relevant areas of natural vegetation.

## Resilience Structure

The **Resilience Structure** creates discontinuities in the landscape to reduce the speed and intensity of fires. It includes fuel management strips and strategic areas of fuel management mosaics that help limit fire spread and reduce the vulnerability of natural and built heritage.
