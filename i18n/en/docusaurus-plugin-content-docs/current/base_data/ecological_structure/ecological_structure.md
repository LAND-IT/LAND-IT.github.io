# Ecological Structure

The Ecological Structure aims to ensure the ecological functioning of the landscape and the conservation of natural resources. The Structure includes permanent and temporary watercourses, water bodies, valley bottoms, ridgelines with hilltops and headwaters, as well as areas of natural vegetation of particular relevance for nature conservation. These elements ensure essential ecological functions and create barriers to the perpendicular spread of fire along the slope.
