# Resilience Structure

The Resilience Structure ensures the creation of discontinuities in the landscape and the reduction of fire spread speed and intensity. It partly coincides with the ecological structure, but it is also associated with fuel management strips and strategic fuel management mosaic areas, in order to limit fire propagation, reduce its effects, facilitate suppression, isolate potential ignition sources, and decrease the vulnerability of natural and built heritage.
