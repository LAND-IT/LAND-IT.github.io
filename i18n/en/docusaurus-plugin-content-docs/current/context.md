# Context

Over the past decades, the Municipality of Mação has been marked by the migration of people from rural to urban areas. The drastic reduction of the population and the resulting abandonment of agricultural and pastoral activities led to forests and shrubland becoming the dominant land use in the municipality. This led to an increase in biomass load. In summer, with high temperatures combined with this accumulated biomass, large-scale wildfires occur, such as those in 2017, which destroyed around 67% of the municipality.

To address this problem, the Municipality of Mação and Aflomação defined nine AIGP – Integrated Landscape Management Areas, aimed at promoting the coordinated management and use of agroforestry spaces. Their goal is to restore the landscape, diversify land uses, and increase resilience to wildfires. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop OIGP – Integrated Landscape Management Operations, a framework that defines the actions to be implemented, as well as their management, monitoring, and financing.

The process of creating an OIGP is lengthy, complex, and detailed, as it requires analyzing the current land use, proposing new uses, comparing alternatives, and estimating costs—all within a territory divided into many small properties. When carried out using tools such as Excel or ArcMap, the process becomes slower and more prone to errors.

It was in this context that the need for a digital solution arose: LAND IT. This system allows us to reproduce the entire planning process of an OIGP, enabling the creation of scenarios, version management, and proposal comparison. Its goal is to make the process faster and more reliable, ensuring that OIGPs are produced with greater accuracy and quality.
