LAND IT version 4.0.0 is now available. Below is the list of changes and new features.

<!-- truncate -->

-    Change of the framework for map and geometry visualization: ArcGIS JS was completely removed and now LAND IT uses OpenLayers
-    Incorporation of raster layers in the system:
     -  The user can import raster layers in TIFF format or add them via URL in TIFF and WMS formats
     -  Addition of a small menu to change the map background layer, where there are both vector and raster layers
-    Improvements in the legend: the legend is now interactive, i.e., the user can select legend elements and the corresponding geometries will appear highlighted on the map
-    Addition of an attribute list: for each layer it is possible to open the list and analyze all attributes and respective values of the geometries contained in it
-    Addition of unit tests to ensure the constant integrity and correct functioning of the system
-    Expansion of the layer update system: all AIGP and territorial layers now belong to this system and when updated it is necessary to propagate the changes to the affected scenario versions
-    Corrections to the functionality of updating the POSA
-    Corrections of bugs detected by unit tests
-    Performance improvements when saving geometries in the database
