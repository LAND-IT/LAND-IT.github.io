-    The method of matching polygons to complementary operations was changed to be able to read them directly from the scenario import;
-    IDs were added to scenario polygons so that it is possible to change the ID of the polygon object without changing the polygon itself;
-    Correction of a bug in the calculation of areas of use proposals that happened when there were polygons without associated transformation.
