LAND IT version 3.9.0 is now available. Below is the list of changes and new features.

<!-- truncate -->

-    Updates were made to the ecosystem services calculation method: for newer AIGPs some types of FGC do not count for EP attribution;
-    Now entities and execution variants are also present in the POSP and not just in transformations;
-    The scenario import functionality now accepts importing only the POSP, without the UIs;
-    It is now possible to automatically assign transformations to polygons without transformations based on the knowledge base without them having a previous transformation;
-    Updates to the knowledge base may return conflicts that the user will have to resolve, namely when importing a scenario;
-    NEW FEATURE: It is now possible to assign transformations to groups of polygons that have the same territory characteristics;
-    In the transformations menu, in transformation units, when editing a unit without a version filter, the user will be updating a unit that will affect all versions in which it is present. This action has a confirmation warning. To change a unit and have these changes propagated only to a version, simply select a version in the respective filter;
-    When adding an editing layer, the user can now delete the attributes they defined.
-    Bug fixes:
     -    Some layers with overlapping polygons were causing an error when imported into the system;
     -    Layers with special characters in the name were causing an error when exported;
     -    Correction of some values in the statistics menu of a version;
     -    When adding/deleting territorial/AIGP layers, the layer list was not being updated automatically.
