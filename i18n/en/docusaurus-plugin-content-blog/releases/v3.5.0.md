-    In the editing menu, two buttons were added, one for undo and another for redo, so that the user can undo/redo their actions while changing the geometries of the layers contained in the map. These changes can refer to editing, addition, and deletion.
-    The log mechanism allows recording the main actions of users within LAND IT, in order to understand which tools are most used, least used, and help in bug detection.
-    The following bugs were also resolved:
     -    Some editing pop-ups appeared with empty fields, now they appear with the current information of what is being edited;
     -    When duplicating another user's scenario, some errors were occurring, such as the wrong attribution of who would be editing the scenario, and even the owner of the scenario;
     -    When manipulating geometries, not all changes were being represented on the map instantly;
     -    When adding a polygon to the POSP of a scenario, sometimes the map representing the polygon(s) to be added turned all blue and did not show any geometry.
