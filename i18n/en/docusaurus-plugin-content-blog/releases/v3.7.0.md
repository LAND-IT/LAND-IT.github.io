LAND IT version 3.7.0 is now available. Below is the list of changes and new features.

<!-- truncate -->

-    When importing a scenario, complementary operations are automatically read from the shapefile and assigned to the respective transformations
-    Added option to manage the transformation associated with a complementary operation
-    When exporting a version, it is no longer necessary to associate complementary operations with a transformation, as this association is expected to be previously made, either by import or manually
-    Bug fixes:
     -    When inserting polygons into complementary operations, the operations possible to insert the polygons were not always appearing
